# Project One - Movie history

## Description

Movie history is a simple multi-tiered application in Java EE that applies the patterns and
techniques presented during the AMT 2019 lectures. 
The idea of this app is that for each user it is possible to keep a history of the movies seen
so far. If the film exists in the database, the user can mark it as seen. If not, he can add
a new movie.

There are three lists in this application. The list of all users, all movies and all movies
seen for a given user.

## Using Movie history 

:warning:

To use Movie history, you can build the app with `Docker`.
* `docker-compose up --build`
* Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
